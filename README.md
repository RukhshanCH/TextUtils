# 📝 TextUtils Web App – Text Manipulation Tool with Dark Mode

I built a powerful and user-friendly text utility web app using React.js, designed to perform common text operations efficiently. This single-page application features:

✂️ Text transformations (Uppercase, Lowercase, Clear, Copy, Remove Extra Spaces)

📊 Real-time word and character count

⚙️ Instant preview and summary of entered text

🌙 Dark Mode / Light Mode toggle for better accessibility and user comfort

⚡ Fast, responsive design with smooth UI transitions

🔒 No external backend – 100% client-side and privacy-focused

Perfect for users who need quick and clean text processing with a sleek interface and theme flexibility.
